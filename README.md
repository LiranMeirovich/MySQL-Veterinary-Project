# MySQL-Veterinary-Project

In our project we've created a system example in sql for managing a veterinary clinic, 
the system assists in tracking information about various entities in the system among them workers for the clinic, clients and their pets and orders that the clients
can make within the clinic.


Description of the files uploaded:
- ERD, illustrates the way the system is built
- Create and Insert sql files are used to create and insert the data base in sql, we've added a small amount of examples that are relevant for the queries we wrote for the system.
- Querie/Procedure/Trigger files to gain relevant information from the system and make automatic updates to the system.
